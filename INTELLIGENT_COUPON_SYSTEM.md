# Intelligent Coupon Management System

## Overview
The enhanced coupon management system has been transformed into an intelligent, fraud-aware, and context-sensitive discount engine with advanced customer segmentation, rule-based validation, and comprehensive analytics.

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Advanced Coupon Rules Engine
The system now supports sophisticated conditional logic:

- **First Order Validation**: "Valid only on first order"
- **Returning Customer Logic**: "Valid only for returning users with 2+ successful orders"
- **Category-based Rules**: "Apply only if cart contains products from a specific category"
- **Cart Value & Quantity Rules**: "Valid only if cart total > ‚ÇπX and quantity > Y"
- **Time-based Rules**: "Valid only on weekends" or "Valid during festive period"

### üéØ Customer Segmentation Logic
Intelligent customer classification without OTP requirements:

- **New User**: `order_count == 0`
- **Returning User**: `order_count >= 1`
- **High-Value Customer**: `total_spend > ‚Çπ10,000`
- **Loyal Customer**: `order_count >= 2`
- **Cart Abandoner**: User added products but no order in 7 days
- **Dormant Customer**: No orders in 30+ days

### üõ°Ô∏è Fraud Control System
Advanced fraud detection without OTP verification:

- **IP-based Detection**: Tracks coupon usage from same IP address
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Monitors multiple accounts from same device/browser
- **Velocity Checks**: Detects rapid succession coupon usage
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies suspicious behavior patterns
- **Automatic Actions**: Flag, block, or require verification for suspicious activity

### üõí Order Context Awareness
Smart coupon suggestions based on cart and user profile:

- **Cart-aware Filtering**: Only shows valid coupons for current cart
- **Auto-apply Logic**: Automatically applies best eligible coupon
- **Personalized Messages**: Custom messages with user name/ID embedded
- **Real-time Validation**: Instant eligibility checking during cart updates

### üìä Comprehensive Analytics
Advanced tracking and performance metrics:

- **Redemption Rate**: Conversion tracking per coupon
- **Revenue Impact**: Direct revenue attribution to coupons
- **Fraud Attempts**: Security incident monitoring
- **Segment Usage**: Performance breakdown by customer segments
- **ROI Analysis**: Return on investment calculations
